There are several ways to participate in the Hackathon:

* by building a science team or a cross-cutting activity
* by joining a science team and/or cross-cutting activity;
* by exploring in loose collaboration with others.
* work on your own.

Over the course of the hackathon it is conceivable that you do all of the above. The primary platform to collaborate within teams and across nodes is built on [GitHub](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon).

#### Build a Science or Cross-cutting Activity

To buid a team or activity you need to describe what it is about, propose specific analyses or tasks, and coordinate the activities of people who join your team.  The preferred way to initiate a team or an activity is to [**open a pull request**](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams) that creates a directory, add a description in the README of your team following the template provided by the list of [existing teams]({{< ref "scienceteams.md" >}}) or [activities]({{< ref "crosscutting.md" >}}). Please give your group an **unique identifier** following the pattern 'hk25-uid'. Once you choose your identifier, please refer to your [working repository](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams) in your description.

In the case that you have an idea that overlaps with ideas already being used to build a team, contact the team-lead of the existing team and explore the possibility of joining the team, or jointly coordinating the team.

For those not familiar with git, we hope you can learn to use the git repo to post an issue that describes your activity, and we will help you get started.  Of course if you have any difficulties, you can contact us directly by sending an email to {{<icon class="fa fa-envelope">}}&nbsp;[yuting.wu@mpimet.mpg.de](mailto:yuting.wu@mpimet.mpg.de)

#### Join a Science Team or Cross-cutting Activity

Joining a team  or activity is easy, simply review the list of [science teams]({{< ref "scienceteams.md" >}}) or [cross-cutting activities]({{< ref "crosscutting.md" >}}) and join the mattermost channel (hk24-team-shortname) corresponding to the team and/or activity that interests you. Signing up to a team can happen any time.  Participation in cross-cutting activities may require pre-registration, and may often involve simultaneous activities within a team.  For preparation, you can already explore the namespace allocated to teams and activities in the GitHub repository [hk25-teams](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams) and [hk25-activities](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams). Just look for their identifier. Depending on how ambitious the various projects are, it might be possible to join more than one team, but please clarify your role and degree of commitment with the coordinator of the teams/activities that you join.

#### Explore tutorials in loose collaboration

For those who don't want to build a team, or join a team, it is still possible to explore the data with others.  For this purpose a collaborative environment will be set up for those not affiliated with a team to exchange with others about what they are doing. Simply [open an issue](https://github.com/digital-earths-global-hackathon/hk25-teams/issues), refer to the identifier of the science lead and start a discussion. In addition some tasks will be suggested that help new users get started with their own analysis.

#### Work on your own

Experienced users might have a clear idea of what they want to accomplish during the Hackathon.  However, because not all models will be hosted on all nodes, working on your own may preclude you from applying your analysis to all of the models.  For that you would need to build a team.
